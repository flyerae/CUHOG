CUHOG
=====

A HOG implementation on CUDA, which is compatible with Pedro Felzenszwalb's 31-dim HOG seamlessly.

This implementation is based on fastHOG [1] and groundHOG [2]. Our real-time object detection system will be released in next version associated with the Coarse-to-fine [3].
An example with matlab interface will also give. Currently, for a 640x480 image takes only 50 ms in average and the real-time object detection can achieve 10 FPS in GTX560 and 2.6GHZ 4-core CPU.
